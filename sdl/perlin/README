Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?)

   The project task was to draw a 2D image using the SDL drawing primitives.
   I've always loved maps, and seeing some of Dr. Malloy's skyrim adventures
   made me want to create a fantasy map generator. The program generates three
   layers of perlin noise, scales it down between [0,1], and then maps those
   values to a set of user defined color divisions. The results can be modified
   by changing the noise scales, the noise layer ratios, or the color divisions.

   Image Drawn: A fantasy map with landmasses and water, containing varying
   heights across the surface.

   Controls:
      Pan camera: arrow keys
      Generate new map (increment perlin seed): space bar

   Noise Library References:
   https://github.com/sol-prog/Perlin_Noise
   https://solarianprogrammer.com/2012/07/18/perlin-noise-cpp-11/

   All code in Perlin.cpp and .h belongs to Solarian Programmer.

The easiest part of this project:
   Converting the drawCircle() function into one that filled everything but the
   circle.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
   Some of the free noise libraries online had much more functionality than I
   needed for this project. I ended up using a version from Solarian that was
   only concerned with basic perlin noise.

	In addition, there were a few warnings from -Weffective c++ that dealt with
	initializer lists I hadn't considered before. Mostly for using it to
	initialize my div vector in colorPicker to be empty.
