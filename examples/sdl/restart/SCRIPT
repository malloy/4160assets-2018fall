To incorporate the game over screen:

-- Changes in main to permit recreation of the engine
  -- Loop (does it have to be a pointer?)
  -- Receive booleam from Engine::play()

-- Changes to engine.h:
  -- convert Engine::play return value from void to bool
  -- Review changes in engine.h ==> player and sprites

-- Changes to engine.cpp:
  -- Change engine::play to return bool:
    -- return true if player chooses R
    -- return false if reach bottom of event loop
  -- initialization of assets in constructor
  -- set objectToTrack to player
  -- CAUTION -- tracker always needs something to track
  -- engine::draw -- messages
  -- engine::update -- remove exploded sprites
  -- Look at option if player chooses R

-- Changes to Drawable: add two functions: explode, explosionDone

-- Changes to sprite.h:
  -- add prototypes for explode and explosionDone
  -- add variable: ExplodingSprite::explosion
  -- add destructor

-- Changes to sprite.cpp:
  -- destructor for explosion
  -- initialize explosion for ALL constructors
  -- write function Sprite::explode (easy for Sprite)
  -- write function Sprite::explosionDone
  -- look at draw
  -- look at update

-- Changes for MultiSprite:
  -- explode is different -- check it out
