Overview: This demo is, basically, the tracker framework with two
sprites rolling around the world. However, within the world are two
lights whose number, location, brightness, and size, are specified
in the XML for the game.

To convert an existing tracker framework to contain the lights:
(1) copy the 6 files into the game directory: lights.h, lights.cpp,
    light.h, light.cpp, triple.h, triple.cpp.
(2) Add information about the lights to your XML document.
(3) Add to engine.h: 
    #include "lights.h"
    Lights lights;
(4) Add to engine.cpp:
    lights(), to constructor
    lights.draw();
    lights.update();
(3) compile and run.
