Using this version of the Light and Lights classes, the light
will automatically track the object currently being tracked;
of course you can hit the "t" key and change the tracked object.
It works this way because in Light::update I use the Viewport
singleton to get the position of the object being tracked.

The (x, y) coordinates of the light in this sample is the upper
left corner of the bounding box around the light. But I wanted
the player to be in the middle of the light. However, I couldn't 
figure out how to compute the radius of the light so I used a hack:
  There is a field "fakeRadius" in the game.xml file where I guess
  at the radius. If you happen to change some of the parameters
  to the light module you may have to adjust the fakeRadius.

Good luck and let me know if you have problems.
